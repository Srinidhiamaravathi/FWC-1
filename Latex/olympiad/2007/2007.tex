\item Problem 1.  
Real numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ are given. For each $i$ $(1\le i\le n)$ define
\[
d_i=\max\{a_j:1\le j\le i\}-\min\{a_j:i\le j\le n\}
\]
and let
\[
d=\max\{d_i:1\le i\le n\}.
\]

(a) Prove that for any real numbers $x_1\le x_2\le\cdots\le x_n$,
\[
\max\{|x_i-a_i|:1\le i\le n\}\ge \frac{d}{2}.
\]

(b) Show that equality can occur.

\item Problem 2.  
Consider five points $A,B,C,D,E$ such that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram and $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.  
Let $\ell$ be a line through $A$. Suppose that $\ell$ intersects $DC$ at $F$ and $BC$ at $G$.  
Suppose also that $EF=EG=EC$. Prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $DAB$.

\item Problem 3.  
In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is mutual.  
A group is called a clique if each two of them are friends.  
Given that the largest clique has even size, prove that competitors can be arranged into two rooms so that the largest clique in each room has the same size.

\item Problem 4.  
In triangle $ABC$ the bisector of angle $BCA$ meets the circumcircle again at $R$.  
The perpendicular bisectors of $BC$ and $AC$ meet at $P$ and $Q$.  
Let $K$ and $L$ be the midpoints of $BC$ and $AC$.  
Prove that triangles $RPK$ and $RQL$ have the same area.

\item Problem 5.  
Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Show that if
\[
4ab-1\mid(4a^2-1)^2,
\]
then $a=b$.

\item Problem 6.  
Let
\[
S=\{(x,y,z):x,y,z\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\},\ x+y+z>0\}.
\]
Determine the smallest number of planes whose union contains $S$ but does not contain $(0,0,0)$.
