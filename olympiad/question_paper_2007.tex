% ===================== PROBLEM 1 =====================

\textbf{Problem 1.}
Real numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ are given. For each $i$ $(1 \le i \le n)$ define
\[
d_i=\max\{a_j:1\le j\le i\}-\min\{a_j:i\le j\le n\}
\]
and let
\[
d=\max\{d_i:1\le i\le n\}.
\]

(a) Prove that, for any real numbers $x_1\le x_2\le\cdots\le x_n$,
\[
\max\{|x_i-a_i|:1\le i\le n\}\ge\frac{d}{2}.
\]

(b) Show that there exist real numbers $x_1\le x_2\le\cdots\le x_n$ such that equality holds.

% ===================== PROBLEM 2 =====================

\textbf{Problem 2.}
Consider five points $A,B,C,D$ and $E$ such that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram and $BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Let $\ell$ be a line passing through $A$.
Suppose that $\ell$ intersects the interior of the segment $DC$ at $F$ and intersects line $BC$ at $G$.
Suppose also that $EF=EG=EC$.
Prove that $\ell$ is the bisector of angle $DAB$.

% ===================== PROBLEM 3 =====================

\textbf{Problem 3.}
In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends.
Friendship is always mutual.
Call a group of competitors a \emph{clique} if each two of them are friends
(In particular, any group of fewer than two competitors is a clique).
The number of members of a clique is called its \emph{size}.

Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even,
prove that the competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that
the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size
of a clique contained in the other room.

% ===================== PROBLEM 4 =====================

\textbf{Problem 4.}
In triangle $ABC$ the bisector of angle $BCA$ intersects the circumcircle again at $R$,
the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ at $P$, and the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ at $Q$.
The midpoint of $BC$ is $K$ and the midpoint of $AC$ is $L$.
Prove that the triangles $RPK$ and $RQL$ have the same area.

% ===================== PROBLEM 5 =====================

\textbf{Problem 5.}
Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.
Show that if $4ab-1$ divides $(4a^2-1)^2$, then $a=b$.

% ===================== PROBLEM 6 =====================

\textbf{Problem 6.}
Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Consider
\[
S=\{(x,y,z):x,y,z\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\},\;x+y+z>0\}
\]
as a set of $(n+1)^3-1$ points in three-dimensional space.
Determine the smallest possible number of planes, the union of which contains $S$
but does not include $(0,0,0)$.
